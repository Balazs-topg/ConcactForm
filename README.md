# ConcactForm
The goal of this repo is to practice html forms, aswell as practicing the styling aspect of it. There may even be some JS involved.
This project is part of "The Odin Project" curriculum.
My goal is not to replicate the design given to me by TOP but to make it my own. (I'm going to make a contact form insted of a sign-up form)
